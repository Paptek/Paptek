- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paptek
- 👀 I’m interested in programming a bit too vague but I am still learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development, not an easy feat when self-learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects once I have my feet wet in this new world.
- 📫 How to reach me jpdhlameni@gmail.com
